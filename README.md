## About

I was inspired to pursue this project because I used PuTTY to access my school's linux environment. And there were so many times where I just wanted to say "Please give me a BASH script that does: XYZ" and just have it manifest in front of me instead of having to type it out on a console that would frequently crash due to the poor internet in my apartment. 

As I worked on the project I realized that the potential for this type of program was much larger than a simple BASH script generator. It could serve as a medium for interactive learning for aspiring developers, teaching them the fundamentals of how to translate their ideas into code. Or it can be used by designers who can't afford to hire a developer to add functionality to their webstie. And so I shifted my goals from a simple executable to a web application that can be accessed by anyone.

This has been an ongoing side project of mine and I expect to bring it to full fruition later this year.
